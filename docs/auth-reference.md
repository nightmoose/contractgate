# Authentication Reference

**Last updated:** 2026-07-22 (bot signup cleanup + Turnstile/honeypot/rate-limit)

ContractGate's Rust backend supports two authentication mechanisms for the
management API: a Supabase Bearer JWT and a DB-backed API key.  The validation
hot path (`/ingest`, `/v1/ingest`, `/egress`) follows the same rules but its
scope is additionally bounded by the key's `allowed_contract_ids` list, which
is now enforced on every hot path (RFC-065).

---

## Mechanisms

### Bearer JWT (recommended for dashboard / browser sessions)

Supabase issues an RS256 session token after sign-in.  Send it as:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

The backend verifies the token against the project's JWKS endpoint, looks up
the user's primary org membership, and treats that org as the request's
authoritative `org_id`.  No additional header is needed.

### DB-backed API key

Issue keys through the dashboard (Account → API Keys).  Key issuance is
**server-side only** (RFC-056): the dashboard calls `POST /api/keys` on the
Next.js server, which generates the raw key with a CSPRNG, hashes it
server-side, and returns the raw key exactly once.  The raw key is never
stored anywhere and cannot be retrieved again.

Send the raw key on every API request as:

```
x-api-key: cg_live_<48 hex chars>
```

Each key row stores its owning `org_id`.  All management API calls are
automatically scoped to that org.  See [Key Management reference](./key-management-reference.md)
for the full issuance and revocation API.

### Local-dev escape hatch (`CONTRACTGATE_DEV_NO_AUTH`)

There is **no env-var master key** (the legacy `API_KEY` was removed in
RFC-066). For local development, `make demo`, and the compose smoke test, set
`CONTRACTGATE_DEV_NO_AUTH=1` to run the authenticated surface with no auth (the
backend then trusts the `x-org-id` header for org context). This is the only
way to disable auth, it defaults off, and it must never be set in production.

---

## Org scoping — by-ID routes (RFC-047)

Every `GET / PATCH / DELETE /contracts/{id}/…` and version route is now
org-scoped at the application layer.  The backend connects as the Supabase
service role (bypassing RLS), so the application enforces isolation itself:

- A request with a valid token whose org does not own the target contract
  receives **404 Not Found** (never 403 — UUID existence is not revealed).
- A request with no resolvable org on a prod deployment receives
  **401 Unauthorized**.
- In dev mode (`CONTRACTGATE_DEV_NO_AUTH=1`) org scoping is disabled — all
  contracts are visible regardless of org, preserving `make demo` behaviour.

Routes that are intentionally unscoped (use their own scoping mechanism):

| Route | Scoping |
|---|---|
| `POST /ingest/{id}` | key's `allowed_contract_ids` |
| `POST /v1/ingest/{id}` | key's `allowed_contract_ids` |
| `POST /egress/{id}` | key's `allowed_contract_ids` |
| `GET /public-contracts/*` | public — no auth |
| `GET /published/{ref}` | public or link-token |
| `GET /catalog` | public |

## Breaking change — `x-org-id` header removed (RFC-048)

**Prior to 2026-05-22**, the backend accepted a client-supplied `x-org-id`
header as a fallback when no `ValidatedKey` was present.  This header is
**no longer accepted or trusted**.  Any client that was sending `x-org-id`
must now rely on the Bearer JWT or a DB-backed API key for org context.

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` + `x-org-id: <uuid>` → org from JWT | `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` → org from JWT ✓ (header ignored) |
| `x-api-key: <db-key>` + `x-org-id: <uuid>` → org from DB key | `x-api-key: <db-key>` → org from DB key ✓ (header ignored) |

(The `x-org-id` header is still honoured **only** in dev mode,
`CONTRACTGATE_DEV_NO_AUTH=1`, where no `ValidatedKey` is injected.)

The dashboard's `OrgProvider` has been updated accordingly — it no longer
calls `setApiOrgId` or sends `x-org-id`.

---

## CORS policy — `DASHBOARD_ORIGIN` (RFC-050)

ContractGate uses two CORS layers with different scopes:

**Authenticated surface** (`/contracts/*`, `/ingest/*`, `/egress/*`, `/v1/*`,
`/audit`, `/stats`, `/playground/*`, `/contracts/infer/*`): only origins listed
in `DASHBOARD_ORIGIN` receive an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header.  Requests
from any other origin receive no CORS header and are rejected by the browser.

Allowed methods: `GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS`.  
Allowed headers: `Authorization, Content-Type, Accept, x-api-key`.

> **Note on browser “CORS” errors:** If Fly returns **502 Bad Gateway**
> (machine restart, deploy, OOM), the proxy response has **no** CORS
> headers. Chrome then reports a CORS failure even though the root cause is
> the 502. Check `https://contractgate-api.fly.dev/health` and Fly logs
> before changing CORS config.

**Public surface** (`/health`, `/metrics`, `/openapi.json`, `/demo/*`,
`/public-contracts`, `/catalog`, `/published/*`): wildcard `*` — these routes
expose no tenant data and are safe to embed from any origin.

### `DASHBOARD_ORIGIN` environment variable

| Value | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Unset | Startup warning; falls back to `http://localhost:3000` (dev only). |
| `https://app.datacontractgate.com` | Single origin allowed. |
| `https://app.example.com,https://staging.example.com` | Multiple origins, comma-separated. |

Set in production via Fly secrets — **do not commit the value to source control**:

```bash
fly secrets set DASHBOARD_ORIGIN=https://app.datacontractgate.com
```

For local development with `docker compose`, leave `DASHBOARD_ORIGIN` unset
(the fallback `http://localhost:3000` matches the default dashboard port).

## Signup abuse protection (2026-07-22)

An audit found 50 of 57 `auth.users` rows were automated signup-bot noise:
zero logins ever, and a random-token `display_name` (e.g.
`MyOHfgDwwVJmHXxrHs`) instead of a real name. See
`supabase/migrations/035_bot_signup_cleanup.sql` for the removal (not applied
automatically — run it via `supabase db push` when ready). Three defenses now
sit in front of `/auth/signup`:

1. **Cloudflare Turnstile** — the signup form renders a Turnstile widget
   (`dashboard/app/auth/signup/page.tsx`). The token it produces is verified
   server-side at `POST /api/auth/verify-turnstile`
   (`dashboard/app/api/auth/verify-turnstile/route.ts`), which calls
   Cloudflare's `siteverify` endpoint with `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` before the
   client is allowed to call `supabase.auth.signUp()`. The secret never
   reaches the browser.

   | Env var | Where | Notes |
   |---|---|---|
   | `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` | client + server | Public by design. Dev default `1x00000000000000000000AA` (Cloudflare's always-pass test key). |
   | `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` | server only | Get both at https://dash.cloudflare.com → Turnstile → Add site. If unset, the verify route fails closed in production and passes through in dev. |

2. **Honeypot field** — a `website` input, hidden via CSS and skipped by
   `tabIndex={-1}`/`autoComplete="off"`, sits in the signup form. Real users
   never fill it; scripts that blindly fill every field do. If it's non-empty
   on submit, the client pretends signup succeeded without calling Supabase —
   no error is shown, so the bot gets no signal to adapt to.

3. **Rate limiting** — `dashboard/proxy.ts` caps requests to `/api/auth/*` and
   `/auth/callback` at 10 per 5 minutes per client IP, via an in-memory
   token bucket. This is per-instance (soft cap, not a hard global limit
   across all Vercel function instances); for a hard limit, move the bucket
   to Upstash Redis (Vercel Marketplace).

## Summary — resolution order

1. **DB-backed API key** (`x-api-key`) — org from the key row (authoritative).
2. **Bearer JWT** (`Authorization: Bearer`) — org from the Supabase user's
   primary org membership (authoritative).
3. **Dev mode** (`CONTRACTGATE_DEV_NO_AUTH=1`, local only) — no auth; `x-org-id`
   header trusted for org context. Never enabled in production.
